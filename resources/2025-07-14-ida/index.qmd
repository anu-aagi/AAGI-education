- **Data analysis** is a process of cleaning, transforming, inspecting and modelling data with the aim of extracting information.

**Exploratory data analysis**

- EDA is about exploration and discovering unknown insights
- Flexible, iterative, visual and discovering, identifying, formulating

"EDA is an attitude, a flexibility, and a reliance on display, NOT a bundle of techniques." -- Tukey (1980)

**Confirmatory data analysis**

- CDA is to test specific, pre-defined hypotheses using statistical methods.
- Structured, rigorous, statistical for testing, assessing, or concluding.

## Initial Data Analysis

- IDA is the crucial first step in analysing data, involving inspection and exploration before formal statistical analysis. 
-  It helps ensure data quality, identify potential issues, and refine the analysis plan, leading to more reliable and reproducible results. 

- Different name is used to describe the same process, such as:
  - Chatfield (1985) as **_"initial examination of data"_**,
  - Cox & Snell (1981) as **_"preliminary data analysis"_**, and 
  - Rao (1983) as **_"cross-examination of data"_**.

::: {.column width="30%" .f2}

[**Tidy data**]{.red}

1. Each column is a variable.
2. Each row is an observation.
3. Each cell is a single value.


[**Tools**]{.red}

- **Git/GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- Open-source programming languages (e.g. **R** and **Python**) for coding
- **Quarto** with **markdown syntax** for interoperable reproducible reports

## Data Description 

- **Assess the structure and quality of the data**
- We refer them to occasionally as **_data sniffing_** or **_data scrutinizing_**.
- Identify the **observational unit**
- If a comparative experiment, identify the **experimental unit** for every treatment factor
- Describe the missing data distribution 
- Univariate and multivariate distribution
- Visualise the data

## Sanity check your data 

- Use common or domain knowledge to **check if the recorded data have sensible values**. E.g.
  - Are positive values, e.g. height and weight, recorded as positive values with a plausible range?
  - If the data are counts, do the recorded values contain non-integer values?
  - For compositional data, do the values add up to 100% (or 1)? If not is that a measurement error or due to rounding? Or is another variable missing?
- Are data encoded correctly?
- Use independent or external sources 
- Consider if or how data were derived for further sanity check of your data

## Search for unwanted or unexpected structure 

- In addition, numerical or graphical summaries may reveal that there is unwanted structure in the data. E.g.,
  - Does the treatment group have different demographic characteristics to the control group?
  - Does the distribution of the data imply violations of assumptions for the main analysis?

- Consistency of data collection method
- Check if experimental layout given in the data and the description match (In particular, have a check with a plot to see if treatments are randomised.)
